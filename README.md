# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A small Rock Paper Scissors Game that keep tracks of score and updates on screen.

## Note and Disclaimer
Took some influence on the HTML and CSS setup from freecodecamp youtube channel on Rock Paper Scissors tutorial. The JavaScript code is where I strayed off from in addition to implementing a restart button which resets the scores. I am planning to add more capabilities toward this game with JavaScript, possibly adding cookies to add restyling themes.
